    {
        // NOTE: This method could have been done a few ways -
        // The durations and frames would be more efficiently 
        // extracted in a single loop, and might impact runtime
        // for large GIF sequences.
        //
        //  However, I wasn't sure when I first started coding this
        //  if it was safe to use tuples, because I wasn't sure how
        //  this API would interop with Objective-C.
        //
        //  Also, in terms of Big-O (or Theta) the runtime is considered
        //  to be the same. (i.e. O(2 * frameCount) is the same as O(frameCount)
        //  so I'm ignoring this for now.
        //
        //  As I work this part through, it's become a little more
        //  obvious to me that the "right" way to do this would be 
        //  to have a single method that iterates on the GIF data
        //  rather than one for durations and one for frames.
        //
        //  The counterarguments I'm seeing for keeping them seperate:
        //
        //  - It feels slightly wrong to me to pass in an array of tuples
        //    to `animationDuration(with:)` method, when we don't care for
        //    the frames themselves.
        //  - I don't know if ImageIO would ever return a different
        //    number of frames and durations, in which case, how do the
        //    tuples behave?
        //  - We get slightly clearer error logging in case one of them
        //    fails independently of the other. Again, I'm not sure if
        //    this is even possible, but it's a consideration.
        //
        //  I began changing the code to use a single array of tuples but
        //  you end up with the same question in reverse. "Should this be 
        //  two seperate arrays instead of a tuple?"
        //
        //  It comes down to how many iterations do we need to do in order
        //  that the method signatures are clear and that we aren't passing
        //  around extra data. (For example, passing the UIImages into the 
        //  animation duration calculation methods. They only need durations.)
        //
        //  I think the tradeoffs of having an extra couple of lines of
        //  code at the callsite are worth not having to unzip the tuple 
        //  tuple in a couple of places in order to maintain clarity.
        //
        //  UPDATE: It turns out that it's possible to have different array 
        //  lengths, although I'm not sure why. (Try searching for "St..." 
        //  and watch it crash. In the debugger you might be able to get more
        //  context, but since this isn't production, I'm not going to spend
        //  any more time on that. I've added a fix to prevent a crash, but 
        //  GIFs might skip some frames now.
