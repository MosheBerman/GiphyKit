 Get an API key from https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/
 
 Before saving it here, you might want to tell git to 
 ignore future changes to this file, so you don't commit
 your API key back to your repository.
 
 Do that with this command:
 
 > cd /path/to/GiphyKit/
 > git update-index --assume-unchanged ./GIFSearch/Model/APIKey.swift

 You should be all set!
